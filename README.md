# Margocore
Jupyter Notebook with margonem items &amp; mechanisms.

## About
Project was born from the idea of vast complexity related to equipment adjustment in the game [Margonem](https://www.margonem.pl/).
There is many ways to build an equipment set (further called Eq-set) for great evaluation in PvP, especially in terms of players statistics like:
- level
- proffesion
- ability tree

Which gives vast set of possibilities in PvP and chances for small tweaks in eq-set to improve battling.

## Current Stage
Project is being built in spare time, however its content has:
- margonem item statistics scraper from [margohelp.pl](https://margohelp.pl/)
- basic plots and data visualisation on choosed proffesion-items stats
- game structures module for future development

## Future Plans
Although project is at very early stage, the further plans are:
- ANN build to improve eq matching
- Web app along wih user interface

## Technologies &amp; frameworks
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Beatiful Soup

## How to start
For the time being project offers downloading items database &amp; plotting some of the stats.
If you want to run an **.ipynb** file, go and [download](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) conda packet manager.
You may also see the result of conducted analysis here on github without any setting up.
